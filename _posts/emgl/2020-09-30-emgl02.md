### Why CMake?

CMake is cross-platform, is flexible, and is extensible.

With CMake generator, one can easily generate the project / solution files for the preferred IDE on the preferred platform. It allows us to maintain simple compiler and platform independent configuration files while enabling us to work on multiple platforms.

CMake also supports user defined functions which helps to modularize and encourage code reusability. One can begin the project on a single platform, and it is very easy to configure a CMake project to compile on an additional platform.

Furthermore, integrating Emscripten with CMake is also simple. Emscripten provides a very easy to use tool, `emcmake` to help accomplish the task. It also provides a cmake toolchain to work with.

By adopting CMake as the project build system, it ease the effort to maintain the project that targets both Emscripten and desktop build.

### CLion

When I worked on the candies project on Windows with Visual Studio, ReSharper was my best friend. It is extremely useful when I refactored the game play module and reworked the AI module.

And now when I started my little cross-platform project that uses CMake, it is so natural that I directly think of using CLion as the IDE for my new project. 

### Why CLion for CMake?

In my opinion, CLion is the ideal IDE made for the CMake project model. The key features I love about it:
A comprehensive CMake support
The code completion feature for CMake greatly improves the efficiency of writing the CMake files. It also allows auto reloading CMake projects on editing CMakeLsts.txt, which comes in handy. Furthermore the CMake profiles solve the trouble raised from the need to have different toolchains and build configurations for the project.

Find out more on CMake support in CLion [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/features/cmake-support.html).

Also, I use Google test framework for my project, and CLion integrates well with it and provides a really easy way to run the tests.

### Configure CLion for Emscripten build

First go to `Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Toolchains`.

We will add a second toolchain for Emscripten. Set the following fields:

```
C Compiler: <emsdk_path>/upstream/emscripten/emcc
C++ Compiler: <emsdk_path>/upstream/emscripten/em++
```

![](/assets/emgl/02/toolchain.png)

Then we can create a profile that uses the toolchain to build.<br>
Go to `Preferences -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> CMake`.

Add a new profile that uses the Emscripten toolchain. Set the field:

```
CMake options: -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<emsdk_path>/upstream/emscripten/cmake/Modules/Platform/Emscripten.cmake
```
 This will allow the build with this profile to pick up the Emscripten cmake toolchain.

To manage the generated build and compiled unit files, set the Build directory field to desired location.

To toggle between different build profiles, simply go to the top right corner and look for the `Open ‘Edit Run/Debug configurations’` dialog. The drop down list will now show you the new profile and by selecting it will allow CLion to use it for subsequent builds.

I'll recommend to allow CLion auto regenerate whenever a CMakeList.txt is modified. As sometimes you might forget to regenerate before attempt to build.

Alright, now we have successfully configured the CMake project to work on CLion.
