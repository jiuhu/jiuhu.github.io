### Why emscripten?
I like C++ and OpenGL. However it has always been a pain to demo something done on the web. You have to either record a video of your work or port it to WebGL (maybe some javascript exercise).

Until I met [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/introducing_emscripten/index.html), porting your C++ and OpenGL code to the Web platform has suddenly become so simple. All you need to do is make several tweaks, depending on the complexity of your OpenGL implementation and the window system of your choice.

<br>

### What are the differences?

#### The window system

If you have experience with the X Window System, you could jump straight in. Or if you are curious about it, [here you go](https://www.x.org/wiki/DeveloperStart/). However, that is the hard way. Unless you are really keen to know how a window system works on a web browser, I wouldn't recommend going too deep into there as our focus here should be on OpenGL.

Therefore, we will go with GLFW for this tutorial series. GLFW is an open source, small, and well supported multiplatform window system for OpenGL development. And most importantly, Emscripten comes with GLFW, hence we can skip the configuration easily.

#### The main loop

A typical OpenGL application runs in an infinite loop until an interrupt occurrs, like quitting the window. However this behavior is not compatible with a browser event model environment. We simply cannot allow an infinite loop running on the browser, as this will not return the control back to the browser to run other stuff. Hence the browser will flag to users that something got stuck and you will be forced to close it. A detailed explanation from emscripten can be read from [here](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/emscripten-runtime-environment.html#browser-main-loop).

#### The supported OpenGL on Web

Emscripten stated that they support the WebGL-friendly subset of OpenGL ES 2.0 by default. And always remember that it is a port to the web, and do not expect OpenGL 4 to work. A more detailed explanation can be found [here](https://emscripten.org/docs/porting/multimedia_and_graphics/OpenGL-support.html).

<br>

### Some necessary setup

[Download and install emscripten](https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html).

We will start by taking the quick start [example code](https://www.glfw.org/documentation.html) from GLFW. If you haven't worked with GLFW before, I recommend to follow their [quick introduction](https://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/quick.html) first.

<br>

### The code

Every use of new library starts with an include file, the same for emscripten, and what we need is: <br>
`#include <emscripten.h>`

The only modification required is to align the main loop's behavior.

Based on the GLFW example code, the main loop can be break down as the following:

![](/assets/emgl/01/main_loop.png)

As emscripten helps to handle the actual "main loop", we can break out the per frame routine into a function, let's call it `DrawFrame()`.

```
void DrawFrame(GLFWwindow*  window) {
  glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

  glfwSwapBuffers(window);

  glfwPollEvents();
}
```

Thus will simplify the main loop to look like this:

```
while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
  DrawFrame(window);
}
```

Emscripten provides two functions to set our main loop: 
- `emscripten_set_main_loop`, if you have no argument for the main loop.
- `emscripten_set_main_loop_arg`, if you want to pass user defined data to the main loop.

Do note that the first argument, which specified the main event loop for the calling thread, is defined as a C function pointer type:
- `typedef void (*em_callback_func)(void)`
- `typedef void (*em_arg_callback_func)(void*)`

We will use the `emscripten_set_main_loop_arg` version for this tutorial series. As we progress further, we would want to encapsulate our drawing routine.

First modify the function prototype to match `em_arg_callback_func`.

```
void DrawFrame(void* arg);
```

And let emscripten handle it as our main loop
```
emscripten_set_main_loop_arg(DrawFrame, window, 0, true);
```

Use the preprocessor directive `#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__`, to separate the code for emscripten platform.

```
#ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__
  emscripten_set_main_loop_arg(DrawFrame, window, 0, true);
#else
  while (!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) {
    DrawFrame(window);
  }
#endif
```

Note that you could also write a lambda instead, however capture is not supported due to the plain old C style definition. You would get a complain on the attempt:<br>
`note: candidate function not viable: no known conversion from '(lambda)' to 'em_callback_func' (aka 'void (*)()') for 1st argument.`

<br>

#### Some OpenGL fundamentals

In this sample program, the draw routine only clears our framebuffer. This is done by calling `glClear()` with OpenGL’s default clearing color, which is black. Hence to ensure the code is working expectedly, we could change the clear color. This can be done by calling `glClearColor` with the color of your choice.


<br>

### How to build?
Now we have everything ready, it is time to build.

For this tutorial, we will use the Emscripten Compiler Frontend (emcc) to compile our program in the Emscripten environment.

As we use the modern C++ standard, we can specify this flag to select the C++ standard used by the compiler: `-std=c++11`

Since we are using GLFW, include the flag to the build command: `-s USE_GLFW=3`.

Finally, you can choose to design your own html to contain the javascript: `-o main.html`
 or let emcc generates one for you.

Hence gives us the following build command:
```
emcc main.cc -std=c++11 -s USE_GLFW=3 -o main.html
```

Now run the build command and try to open the generated `main.html` (example, by double clicking the file).

Hold on... why am I seeing a black screen, with an infinite preparing ??? <br>
![](/assets/emgl/01/cors_rule.png)

Try open up the web console, and most likely you will see the following message: <br>
`a.out.js:1760 Fetch API cannot load file:///D:/emgl/a.out.wasm. URL scheme must be "http" or "https" for CORS request.`

Unfortunately, browsers like Chrome, Edge, and Safari do not support the `file://` XHR requests, and will not load extra files like .wasm for your html. For these browsers you’ll need to serve the files using a web server.

If you have python, you can use the python SimpleHTTPServer. Go to your project directory on a terminal and run the following command: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` <br>
then open `http://localhost:8080/main.html`.

Alternatively, you could build with the linker flag: `--emrun`.

Then from your project directory, you can now launch your html with emrun, `emrun main.html`.

<br>

### Simple output

Here is a sample output of the sample program, with the framebuffer clear with the selected color.

<canvas id="canvas" tabindex="0">Sorry, canvas not supported by your browser.</canvas>
<script type='text/javascript'>
  var Module = {
    canvas: (function() {
      var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
      canvas.addEventListener("webglcontextlost", function(e) {
        alert('WebGL context lost. You will need to reload the page.');
        e.preventDefault();
      }, false);
      return canvas;
    })(),
  };
</script>
<script async type="text/javascript" src="/assets/emgl/01/00_window.js"></script>

<br>

### What's next?

Yes, now we have an OpenGL window ready on the web, it is time to cast your magic into it!

Before that, it would be good to spare some time to read a bit more about [optimizing WebGL](https://emscripten.org/docs/optimizing/Optimizing-WebGL.html) and emscripten supported [build flags](https://emscripten.org/docs/compiling/Building-Projects.html), such as optimization and debug information.
